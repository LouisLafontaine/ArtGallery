It would result in a stunning and unique property, which included the most exciting garden - designed by the artist - and its Water Lily Pond. Planning permission was granted in 1893 and he spent much of his focus on the bridge in his works. Incredibly, he only painted about three works of the lily pond up to 1897, This work, from 1899, is exquisite in its composition of background trees, weeping willow, and the bridge, which underwent many alterations up to 1910. The pond here is literally obliterated by vegetation and lilies. It is composed of short brushstrokes - a familiar method during his mature years. In a letter, Monet described how he had planted the water lilies for fun - he had never intended painting them, however, once they established themselves they almost became his only source of inspiration. He wrote: \"I saw, all of a sudden, that my pond had become enchanted... Since then, I have had no other model.\""),

It was a time that provided the artist with great fulfillment as a painter, despite the failing health of Camille. Paul Durand-Ruel, Monet's art dealer, helped support him during this time, where he found great comfort from the picturesque landscapes that surrounded him and provided him with plenty of subject matter from which to choose. It was a time that Monet's Plein air works would develop, and this particular painting was shown at the first Impressionist exhibition of 1874.\n" +

In the landscape, a mother and child pair in the foreground and another in the background are merely a pretext for drawing the diagonal line that structures the painting. Two separate color zones are established, one dominated by red, the other by a bluish-green.

The vibrant blue, yellow, and red colors were used by Monet to depict the sunset. Across the lagoon we see Venice, a famous island church in Venice, Italy."

Monet depicts a mist, which provides a hazy background to the piece set in the French harbor. The orange and yellow hues contrast brilliantly with the dark vessels, where little, if any detail is immediately visible to the audience. It is a striking and candid work that shows the smaller boats in the foreground almost being propelled along by the movement of the water. This has, once again, been achieved by separate brushstrokes that also show various colors \"sparkling\" on the sea.\n" +

They organized their exhibition on their own as they were usually rejected at the Paris Salon. Most visitors were disgusted and even outraged over such a graffiti. Monet's Impression, Sunrise enjoyed the most attention and some visitors even claimed that they were absolutely unable to recognize what was shown at all.\n" +

Louis Leroy, wrote a now-famous article in Le Charivari in which he used the term \"Impressionist\" based on the title of this painting. Despite the fact that Leroy had used the word derisively, the group decided to adopt it and painters such as Renoir and Degas were happy to be called Impressionists.\n" +

                        "Despite its notoriety, the painting is in some ways untypical of Monet's own work of this period and of Impressionism more generally. It shows little of the Impressionist treatment of light and colour. The colours are very restrained and the paint is applied not in discrete brushstrokes of contrasting colours but in very thin washes. In some places, the canvas is even visible and the only use of impasto is in the depiction of the reflected sunlight on the water. The painting is strongly atmospheric rather than analytical and has a spirit somewhat akin to Turner's works. Nevertheless, it does illustrate particularly well one of the features of an Impressionist painting that was thought so revolutionary. The technique is very 'sketchy' and would have been seen as a preliminary study for a painting rather than a finished work suitable for exhibition. (Monet himself saw the work as unfinished, and it was for that reason that he adopted the title 'Impression' to distinguish it from such works as his other view of Le Havre in the same exhibition, though this too lacks the finish than expected.) In this work, Monet stripped away the details to a bare minimum: the dockyards in tile background are merely suggested by a few brushstrokes as are the boats in the foreground. The whole represents the artist's swift attempt to capture a fleeting moment. The highly visible, near-abstract technique, compels almost more attention than the subject-matter itself, a notion then wholly alien to viewers.\n" +

The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series begun at the end of summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, using that year's harvest. Some use a broader definition of the title to refer to other paintings by Monet with this same theme. The series is known for its thematic use of repetition to show differences in perception of light across various times of day, seasons, and types of weather.

Indeed, the haystacks themselves were situated just outside his door. He was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region's landscape and the variation in the seasons."

The shadows and the light contrast beautifully against the background of trees, ice sky, and snowcovered buildings.

                description = "Monet's paintings of his water-garden and water-lilies at Giverny occupied him for many years in the latter part of his life and were his last great work. Like the works of Turner in the final stage, they were for a long time misunderstood and unappreciated but similarly revived in esteem in the light of modern reappraisal. By the end of 1890 Monet was making enough from the sales of his pictures to buy his house at Giverny outright and soon after began improvements to the garden which included the formation of a pond from a marshy tract by damming a stream that ran into the river Epte. He had a bridge built over the pond in Japanese taste' and his first paintings of the water-garden in a series, 1899-1900, give prominence to the bridge with water-lilies beneath and weeping willows, by that time well-grown, around it. These pictures formed a quiet beginning to what was to become an increasingly exciting enterprise.\n" +

                        "In the second phase of forty-eight pictures produced between 1903 and 1908, he dispensed with the bridge which had been a somewhat conventional accessory, set his angle of vision nearer to the water surface and composed his picture simply of the water-lilies and reflections in the water, with only a suggestion of trees and other vegetation on the banks in the background. The pond became a sort of magic mirror holding such amazing depth and beauty of color and variety of light as can be appreciated here. More akin to Japan in spirit that the hump-backed bridge was the decorative sense that Monet now displayed in the selection of the areas of blue and green leaf and the touches of white and red in vivid design against the deeps of color to the right and in the foreground of this painting. As the series continued Monet made modifications in his scheme of design; although he used large canvases he limited the number of plants to appear in them and increased their size. Finally he painted them from almost directly overhead, thus eliminating normal perspective, the play of light on the surface place being now the main feature. In this decorative treatment, as may be noticed in other works of the turn of the century, there came a certain suggestion of art nouveau."

It was three years since the death of Camille and he had a new arrangement with Alice Hoschede whom he would later marry following her husband's death in 1892, At this time, once again, Monet was plagued by financial worries. An economic recession in France had greatly affected the sales of his works and he was less than keen on the forthcoming Impressionist exhibition due to differences within the group. He settled in the fishing village of Pourville for a time and became increasingly encouraged by his new surroundings. Alice and her children joined him during the summer. It is thought that the two young women depicted are Marthe and Blanche, two of Alice's daughters, while other commentators suggest the woman is Alice herself accompanied by one of her children.\n" +

The grass - composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes - appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women's wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-radiographs show that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky."

These fields of tulips, split into different colors that formed geometric bands of solid contrasting color across the flat landscape, were an ideal subject for Monet.
